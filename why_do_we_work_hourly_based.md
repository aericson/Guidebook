# Why do we work hourly based

## The traditional software development model or "making estimations"

The old school model of software development is based on estimations. In this model the project is **theoretically** planed and executed in the following way:

Project estimation -> internal development of the estimated features -> delivery to the client

## What they don’t say about estimations
Although the cycle seem very straight forward, it’s a lie. None of this phases ever occur as planed.
The problem starts at the very beginning when people try to estimate how long will a individual or a team will take to develop something. No one was ever able to successfully estimate a project that lasts more than 3 months. It’s simply not possible, things that looked simple are much more complex when development starts, other break and take long to be fixed, integrations between different parts of the software are rarely smooth and most times are not taken in account during estimation. 
Then there’s the development phase, where everything go out of schedule, the team starts to learn about the project and has to change many of the planned things only because they were not correctly understood at the very beginning and start to became more clear as they turn into code. This is also many times a problem, because it’s often not possible to be sure that something is correct until the client sees it and validates. 
And there’s also the client that often does not know exactly what he wants at the beginning of the project. And even when he knows, it’s often wrong and he learns about it as the project is built causing frequent changes. The last type of change is the ones that have no apparently meaning, they go like this: "i want to change this from blue to red", without no apparent reason.
When the project is about to finish there’s always a thousand very small issues to be done. They look very small and it’s easy to get mislead thinking that it’s going to be fast to finish them. It will not. Those normally take longer than the others.
By the end everything conspires to delays.

## How a project with “no estimations” works

Given that we now know that estimations do not work, lets talk about what is this "no estimates" thing. Not estimating means that the project will not have a predefined duration, it will last until the client is satisfied with it or the budget finishes. One important thing about it: selling projects this way is much harder because clients are scared of not knowing how much they will spend. But lets take a look on the benefits.
The first and most obvious one is that we will be charging hourly based and we won't have to estimate. As we previously saw, estimating is hard and error prone. This means that things will take the time they take to be developed. We will have time to study whatever needs to be studied, think as much it needs to be though and test as much as the project requires. All of this allows aus to develop quality beautiful code!

For the client point of view, he wont need to waste time planning features that will change during development. Since there are no planned features, the client can always change things on the go or even completely refocus the project. This also forces the client be closely watching what is being developed as he will be planning next iterations with us, so there’s less risk of a feature being wrongly developed before the client notices. And lastly, he will understand that his money goes away everytime he changes things or add unnecessary features, this forces him to plan better and not waste time.

## How about charging on the “perceived value” of the project

There are many ways to charge for a software project, and the one that looks fair and good for us developers is charging based on the value the client will benefit from the project. This is actually very good but this model has some flaws to the way we work. First, we sell a lot to startups and new projects. For this projects normally not even the owner of the project knows how valuable it is. Also we would have to have a fixed budget for the project and everything we talked on the first part of this text would hit us on the back.

# Our Philosophy

- Programmers, not proccesses, nor code, are the most important thing on software engineering.
- The client should be always aware of what is happening, be it good or bad.
- There is no such a thing as the best language or only way to do things. Each project is unique and requires it's own tools.
- Simple beats complex.
- Code should be deployed early and often.
- It does not matter how complex it is, there is always a simple way to explain it so everyone can understand, and be aware of it.
- Tdd, bdd, integration tests, unit tests... you name it, as long as you are writing and running automated tests.
- Community is one of the most important features of a programming language, keep this in mind when choosing one.
- Open source is a heck of a great thing, make the most of it and remember to give it back whenever possible.

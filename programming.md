# Programming style guide

- KISS - Keep it simple, stupid
- Small functions/methods
- Keep it simple
- Design matters
- UX matters even more
- Keep it simple
- Any code should be reviewed by at at least 1 more person
- If there's no way to keep it simple, make sure there are comments
- Commit as often as possible (try not to have "and" in commit messages) 
- And again, Keep it simple
